# Eat Up
Thinking about a delicacy but too lazy to look up for the recipe over the internet again and again? Wondering what tasty meal you can cook that is gluten free? How about an app where you can find thousands of recipe, mark your favourites and access them later? How about accessing only such recipes that are gluten-free or vegan? Presenting UI of one such app, achieved using Flutter.
